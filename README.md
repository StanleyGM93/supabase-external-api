# Supabase External API

## Purpose and Method

This project was designed to implement an external API call to a database schema containint tables of restaurants and "starred" restaurants. In this project I set up the two tables in [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). I then copied the API keys and URL into a .env file before setting up the call to the external Supabase API in the supabase.js file. The bulk of the code was supplied by [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) with instructions on how to set up the project. This project helped me to learn how to access data from a database table and use this in a web app.
